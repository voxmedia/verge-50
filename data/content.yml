           <p>“I’ve said I want to die on Mars. Just not on impact.”</p>

           <p>If anyone on Earth said that, you’d smirk, write it off, and move on. Anyone except perhaps Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire who has made no small plans since earning a fortune selling PayPal to eBay in 2002. In the years since, Musk has spent most of his time floating preposterous ideas and making good on them one by one.</p>

           <p>First came SpaceX, the commercial space venture that has landed government contracts, hovered a reusable launch vehicle over the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4088932/spacex-reusable-rocket-prototype-grasshopper-leaps-to-new-record">Texas skies</a>, and successfully docked a spacecraft with the International Space Station, all with the long-term goal of sending humans to Mars. Space travel, historically the exclusive domain of massive government budgets, is suddenly a viable private venture thanks in part to SpaceX. </p>

           <p>Speaking of expensive, entrenched industries with enormously high barriers of entry, there’s Tesla, the electric automaker founded in 2003. Tesla turned its first profit this year, beating giants to the market in the process with a mass-produced, all-electric family sedan.</p>

           <p>But Tesla might be the tamest, least surprising thing Musk ends up doing in his career as a billionaire with big ideas: he recently proposed and laid out plans for the Hyperloop, an ultra-high-speed mass transit system.</p>

           <p>Rockets, cars of the future, and a gesture-controlled laboratory all underwritten by a seemingly limitless supply of money? It’s no wonder Musk is frequently called a real-life Tony Stark.</p>

           <p>&#8220;Invention requires a long-term willingness to be misunderstood,” Jeff Bezos has said, and in the course of his two-decade career he’s been plenty willing.  Bezos’ company, Amazon.com, has since its founding as an online bookstore in 1994 completely revolutionized the way millions of people shop. The Kindle, which debuted in 2007, became the first explosively popular e-reader. </p>

           <p>This year, while many of his colleagues took the death of print media as a given, Bezos spent money from his own pocket to buy the <em>Washington Post</em>. And in the face of unprecedented concerns about data access he launched Mayday, a next-level customer service feature that lets Amazon reps literally hijack your tablet. </p>

           <p>Now Bezos is squeezing every last drop of delay out of Amazon&#8217;s supply chain, paying the Postal Service for Sunday parcel runs and promising an army of delivery drones for 2015. None of these ideas — e-commerce, e-readers, or faster package delivery — were wholly new when Bezos picked them up. But his singular vision, enthusiasm, and seemingly ruthless business acumen have simultaneously crushed competitors and created new avenues for huge businesses in the process.</p>

           <p>Marissa Mayer shocked the world when she left Google in 2012 to take the reins at fading internet giant Yahoo. At Google, where she’d been for more than a decade, Mayer held many positions: engineer, product manager, designer, and ultimately part of the executive team.</p>

           <p>In the year since she became CEO of Yahoo, she’s jump-started the company&#8217;s product lineup, modernizing nearly every app and service that Yahoo offers while bringing on hundreds of talented engineers and designers through strategic acquisitions, including the $1.1 billion purchase of Tumblr. Today more than 400 million people use Yahoo&#8217;s mobile products every month, and its stock price is up more than 90 percent year over year. </p>

           <p>These successes are due in large part to Mayer, whose focus on building great mobile apps has helped to revive one of the internet&#8217;s oldest brands. And her work extends beyond Yahoo — she sits on the boards of directors for Walmart and Jawbone as well as Yahoo, and works with nonprofit institutions including the San Francisco Ballet and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. She is also the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to be featured in a photo spread in the September issue of <em>Vogue</em>. </p>

           <p>Depending on whom you ask, Daniel Ek, the founder and CEO of streaming music service Spotify, is either saving the music industry or destroying it. </p>

           <p>A Swedish entrepreneur who founded his first company at age 14, Ek was formerly the CEO of uTorrent, the world’s largest BitTorrent client. By founding Spotify in 2006 Ek says he was simply trying to solve an “annoying” problem, not become the head of one of the world’s leading music services. He aims to avoid piracy and work with the major labels, providing an affordable, reliable streaming music service in the process. </p>

           <p>Spotify, now valued above $4 billion, flourishes while its struggling rivals like Rdio and Rhapsody appear poised for extinction as they lay off staff. Spotify’s services, beloved by its 6 million paying customers, are unsurprisingly controversial with music-makers. Ek’s next goal is to gain a dominant position within the market so he can negotiate better royalty payments for artists. Because while artists accuse the company of paying them a pittance for the right to stream their tracks, Spotify, even with all those subscribers, has yet to turn a profit. </p>

           <p>In early 2013, Glenn Greenwald, a former lawyer who’d turned to blogging during several Bush-era scandals, was a columnist for <em>The Guardian</em>. He’d written four books; much of his work focused on constitutional law and civil liberties in post-9/11 America. His work brought him to the attention of Edward Snowden, an unknown former NSA contractor who had secretly copied a trove of classified documents. Snowden’s next move — giving them to Greenwald, documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, and <em>Washington Post</em> reporter Barton Gellman — changed both Snowden’s life and Greenwald’s career trajectory. In June <em>The Guardian</em> began publishing revelatory details of the NSA’s mass-surveillance programs — a story that continues to dominate headlines worldwide. Greenwald, a respected reporter but by no means a household name, was suddenly a very outspoken star.</p>

           <p>Greenwald has used the spotlight to take American journalism to task — it’s failed, he says, in its duty to provide “an adversarial check on the most powerful political and economic factions,” and grown too close to the political and economic powers it’s supposed to monitor. </p>

           <p>Next, with the financial backing of billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, he and other high-profile journalists will set out to restore passion and vitality to their craft with a new news venture expected to launch in 2014. With Greenwald at the helm, it’s unlikely to be a quiet affair.</p>

           <p>Zaha Hadid is one of today’s most celebrated and influential architects — a bold and barrier-breaking designer who has earned a reputation for pushing her field toward more imaginative frontiers. </p>

           <p>Hadid was born and raised in Iraq and has spent the last 40 years in London, where her firm is headquartered. She hasn’t been back to Iraq in decades, but she says it was the rolling dunes and Sumerian ruins of her childhood that sparked her love for architecture at an early age. Her career took off in 1982, when she won a contract to design the never-realized Peak leisure complex in Hong Kong. She soon became known for her curvaceous, sometimes logic-defying aesthetic. Her propensity for futuristic, spectacular designs proved difficult to realize at first, though the past decade has seen an outpouring of Hadid buildings across the globe, raising her to celebrity status in a field traditionally dominated by men. </p>

           <p>In 2004, she became the first woman — and the first Muslim — to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize, and she won the Stirling Prize in both 2010 and 2011. Today, her firm has more than 950 current projects in 44 countries, including the breathtaking Heydar Aliyev center in Azerbaijan, Rome’s MAXXI museum, and most recently the upcoming World Cup stadium in Qatar.    </p>

           <p>But it’s his role as the internet’s favorite scientist that has turned deGrasse Tyson into a bona fide astrophysics rockstar — one with upwards of 1.5 million Twitter followers, a radio show, and an upcoming role hosting the reboot of <em>Cosmos: A Personal Voyage</em>. And while he may not relish the hyper-public profile, deGrasse Tyson tries to put it to good use. “It’s not my goal to do all that I’m doing,” he says. “But I feel a duty to perform this public service, and to help people realize that the fruits of science transform how we live.” With <em>Cosmos</em> now in post-production, deGrasse Tyson hopes to resume the academic research — primarily an analysis of data from the Hubble Space Telescope — that he’s recently been too busy to focus on. </p>

           <p>Even if he steps away from the spotlight, there’s still one place fans will be sure to find him: on Twitter. “Nobody asks me to tweet, but I do it because it comes quite naturally,” he says. “At the rate I’m going, I could keep churning them out for decades to come.”</p>

           <p>In the world of video games, Swedish programmer Markus Persson is a poster boy for the ultimate startup fantasy. In 2009 he left his employer, an established game developer, to focus on a side project.

           <p>One of the most successful independent titles ever, <em>Minecraft</em>’s seemingly simple open world has had an unmistakable influence on the gaming industry at large.

With a background in both biology and health care, Wojcicki was uniquely positioned to launch one of the first — and now the most successful — personal DNA-testing services in the world. At the time of the company’s launch, personal DNA testing was prohibitively expensive; one of 23andMe’s goals was to make it affordable. By 2013 the test’s price was $99 with the goal of getting 1 million tests into 23andMe’s database, and nearly half that many completed. </p>

           <p>The data, which 23andMe also uses for large-scale genetic research into diseases such as Parkinson’s, is its most valuable asset.

           <p>Illinois native Tavi Gevinson started her fashion blog <em>Style Rookie</em> at age 11 in 2008. Combining musings about fashion icons and runway models with pictures of Gevinson’s own eccentric outfits, <em>Style Rookie</em> almost immediately captured the attention of the high fashion world. Within two years Gevinson had appeared in an ad campaign for Rodarte — one of her favorite labels — and been invited as a special guest to New York Fashion Week. </p>

           <p>In 2011, at age 15, she used her blogging experience to launch <em>Rookie</em>, a website aimed at teen girls and conceived as a successor to the smart, iconic ‘90s magazine <em>Sassy</em>. Today, <em>Rookie</em> has over 450,000 unique visitors and 1.2 million visits a month, and Gevinson has published two volumes of a printed <em>Rookie Yearbook</em> which collects illustrations, essays, and interviews with subjects like Morrissey, Emma Watson, and Neil deGrasse Tyson. “Gevinson and friends are forces of nature, a counterbalance to the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, and a great and good face for a new, vigorous, unapologetic feminism,” writes Cory Doctorow in a review of the second volume. </p>

           <p>As she branches out from fashion and publishing, Gevinson is making forays into acting, appearing in 2013 comedy <em>Enough Said</em> alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini. She is currently applying to college and will graduate from high school in 2014.</p>

           <p>Since Dorsey and co-founder Biz Stone built a twttr prototype in two short weeks in 2006, Twitter&#8217;s 140 characters have upended how we think about serious breaking news and live events, all mixed in with the weird, funny, roiling mass of humanity riffing, joking, and complaining every moment of the day. </p>

           <p>Aaron Sorkin would be thrilled with the raw material: Dorsey&#8217;s the handsome public face and roguish intellect of Twitter. He&#8217;s got a penchant for yoga and fashion, constantly <a href="https://twitter.com/jack">spouts off koan-like Tweets</a>, and the brief zen moments of Dorsey&#8217;s trademark <a href="https://vine.co/v/b2qH2U5ZdQ1">Vine selfies</a> would be the perfect on-screen foil to the company&#8217;s juicy history of power struggles and boardroom battles.

           <p>Jony Ive’s resume is short — he’s worked at Apple since 1992, with only a brief, failed toilet-designing stint beforehand — but his legacy is long. From the colorful iMac G3 that stood out in a sea of boxy black PCs to the sleek, machinated iPod that was at once beautiful and intuitive, Ive’s made a career of designing products that are often imitated and rarely equaled — from Apple&#8217;s iconic white headphones to the iPad, Apple&#8217;s products are among the industry&#8217;s most distinctive. Steve Jobs called the native Londoner &#8220;a spiritual partner,&#8221; and after Jobs&#8217; passing Ive&#8217;s influence has only grown: new CEO Tim Cook named him senior vice president of design and tasked him with both hardware and software design. Ive wasted no time in remaking iOS in his own image — simple, beautiful, accessible — and if history is any indication, the copycats will be countless. But by then, Ive will probably be working on something new anyway.</p>
