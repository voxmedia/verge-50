           <p>“I’ve said I want to die on Mars. Just not on impact.”</p>
           <p>If anyone on Earth said that, you’d smirk, write it off, and move on. Anyone except perhaps Elon Musk, the South African-born billionaire who has made no small plans since earning a fortune selling PayPal to eBay in 2002. In the years since, Musk has spent most of his time floating preposterous ideas and making good on them one by one.</p>
           <p>First came SpaceX, the commercial space venture that has landed government contracts, hovered a reusable launch vehicle over the <a href="http://www.theverge.com/2013/3/11/4088932/spacex-reusable-rocket-prototype-grasshopper-leaps-to-new-record">Texas skies</a>, and successfully docked a spacecraft with the International Space Station, all with the long-term goal of sending humans to Mars. Space travel, historically the exclusive domain of massive government budgets, is suddenly a viable private venture thanks in part to SpaceX. </p>
           <p>Speaking of expensive, entrenched industries with enormously high barriers of entry, there’s Tesla, the electric automaker founded in 2003. Tesla turned its first profit this year, beating giants to the market in the process with a mass-produced, all-electric family sedan.</p>
           <p>But Tesla might be the tamest, least surprising thing Musk ends up doing in his career as a billionaire with big ideas: he recently proposed and laid out plans for the Hyperloop, an ultra-high-speed mass transit system.</p>
           <p>Rockets, cars of the future, and a gesture-controlled laboratory all underwritten by a seemingly limitless supply of money? It’s no wonder Musk is frequently called a real-life Tony Stark.</p>

           <p>&#8220;Invention requires a long-term willingness to be misunderstood,” Jeff Bezos has said, and in the course of his two-decade career he’s been plenty willing.  Bezos’ company, Amazon.com, has since its founding as an online bookstore in 1994 completely revolutionized the way millions of people shop. The Kindle, which debuted in 2007, became the first explosively popular e-reader. </p>
           <p>This year, while many of his colleagues took the death of print media as a given, Bezos spent money from his own pocket to buy the <em>Washington Post</em>. And in the face of unprecedented concerns about data access he launched Mayday, a next-level customer service feature that lets Amazon reps literally hijack your tablet. </p>
           <p>Now Bezos is squeezing every last drop of delay out of Amazon&#8217;s supply chain, paying the Postal Service for Sunday parcel runs and promising an army of delivery drones for 2015. None of these ideas — e-commerce, e-readers, or faster package delivery — were wholly new when Bezos picked them up. But his singular vision, enthusiasm, and seemingly ruthless business acumen have simultaneously crushed competitors and created new avenues for huge businesses in the process.</p>

           <p>In the year since she became CEO of Yahoo, she’s jump-started the company&#8217;s product lineup, modernizing nearly every app and service that Yahoo offers while bringing on hundreds of talented engineers and designers through strategic acquisitions, including the $1.1 billion purchase of Tumblr. Today more than 400 million people use Yahoo&#8217;s mobile products every month, and its stock price is up more than 90 percent year over year. </p>
           <p>These successes are due in large part to Mayer, whose focus on building great mobile apps has helped to revive one of the internet&#8217;s oldest brands. And her work extends beyond Yahoo — she sits on the boards of directors for Walmart and Jawbone as well as Yahoo, and works with nonprofit institutions including the San Francisco Ballet and San Francisco Museum of Modern Art. She is also the first CEO of a Fortune 500 company to be featured in a photo spread in the September issue of <em>Vogue</em>. </p>

           <p>Depending on whom you ask, Daniel Ek, the founder and CEO of streaming music service Spotify, is either saving the music industry or destroying it. </p>
           <p>A Swedish entrepreneur who founded his first company at age 14, Ek was formerly the CEO of uTorrent, the world’s largest BitTorrent client. By founding Spotify in 2006 Ek says he was simply trying to solve an “annoying” problem, not become the head of one of the world’s leading music services. He aims to avoid piracy and work with the major labels, providing an affordable, reliable streaming music service in the process. </p>
           <p>Spotify, now valued above $4 billion, flourishes while its struggling rivals like Rdio and Rhapsody appear poised for extinction as they lay off staff. Spotify’s services, beloved by its 6 million paying customers, are unsurprisingly controversial with music-makers. Ek’s next goal is to gain a dominant position within the market so he can negotiate better royalty payments for artists. Because while artists accuse the company of paying them a pittance for the right to stream their tracks, Spotify, even with all those subscribers, has yet to turn a profit. </p>

           <p>In early 2013, Glenn Greenwald, a former lawyer who’d turned to blogging during several Bush-era scandals, was a columnist for <em>The Guardian</em>. He’d written four books; much of his work focused on constitutional law and civil liberties in post-9/11 America. His work brought him to the attention of Edward Snowden, an unknown former NSA contractor who had secretly copied a trove of classified documents. Snowden’s next move — giving them to Greenwald, documentary filmmaker Laura Poitras, and <em>Washington Post</em> reporter Barton Gellman — changed both Snowden’s life and Greenwald’s career trajectory. In June <em>The Guardian</em> began publishing revelatory details of the NSA’s mass-surveillance programs — a story that continues to dominate headlines worldwide. Greenwald, a respected reporter but by no means a household name, was suddenly a very outspoken star.</p>
           <p>Greenwald has used the spotlight to take American journalism to task — it’s failed, he says, in its duty to provide “an adversarial check on the most powerful political and economic factions,” and grown too close to the political and economic powers it’s supposed to monitor. </p>
           <p>Next, with the financial backing of billionaire eBay founder Pierre Omidyar, he and other high-profile journalists will set out to restore passion and vitality to their craft with a new news venture expected to launch in 2014. With Greenwald at the helm, it’s unlikely to be a quiet affair.</p>

           <p>Zaha Hadid is one of today’s most celebrated and influential architects — a bold and barrier-breaking designer who has earned a reputation for pushing her field toward more imaginative frontiers. </p>
           <p>Hadid was born and raised in Iraq and has spent the last 40 years in London, where her firm is headquartered. She hasn’t been back to Iraq in decades, but she says it was the rolling dunes and Sumerian ruins of her childhood that sparked her love for architecture at an early age. Her career took off in 1982, when she won a contract to design the never-realized Peak leisure complex in Hong Kong. She soon became known for her curvaceous, sometimes logic-defying aesthetic. Her propensity for futuristic, spectacular designs proved difficult to realize at first, though the past decade has seen an outpouring of Hadid buildings across the globe, raising her to celebrity status in a field traditionally dominated by men. </p>
           <p>In 2004, she became the first woman — and the first Muslim — to win the Pritzker Architecture Prize, and she won the Stirling Prize in both 2010 and 2011. Today, her firm has more than 950 current projects in 44 countries, including the breathtaking Heydar Aliyev center in Azerbaijan, Rome’s MAXXI museum, and most recently the upcoming World Cup stadium in Qatar.    </p>

And while he may not relish the hyper-public profile, deGrasse Tyson tries to put it to good use. “It’s not my goal to do all that I’m doing,” he says. “But I feel a duty to perform this public service, and to help people realize that the fruits of science transform how we live.” With <em>Cosmos</em> now in post-production, deGrasse Tyson hopes to resume the academic research — primarily an analysis of data from the Hubble Space Telescope — that he’s recently been too busy to focus on. </p>

Within two years Gevinson had appeared in an ad campaign for Rodarte — one of her favorite labels — and been invited as a special guest to New York Fashion Week. </p>
           <p>In 2011, at age 15, she used her blogging experience to launch <em>Rookie</em>, a website aimed at teen girls and conceived as a successor to the smart, iconic ‘90s magazine <em>Sassy</em>. Today, <em>Rookie</em> has over 450,000 unique visitors and 1.2 million visits a month, and Gevinson has published two volumes of a printed <em>Rookie Yearbook</em> which collects illustrations, essays, and interviews with subjects like Morrissey, Emma Watson, and Neil deGrasse Tyson. “Gevinson and friends are forces of nature, a counterbalance to the Manic Pixie Dream Girl, and a great and good face for a new, vigorous, unapologetic feminism,” writes Cory Doctorow in a review of the second volume. </p>
           <p>As she branches out from fashion and publishing, Gevinson is making forays into acting, appearing in 2013 comedy <em>Enough Said</em> alongside Julia Louis-Dreyfus and the late James Gandolfini. She is currently applying to college and will graduate from high school in 2014.</p>

Nothing beyond the name, which may or may not be real, is known of Bitcoin’s creator.</p>

Since he leaked over 50,000 classified documents to journalists at <em>The Guardian</em> and the <em>Washington Post</em>, we now know that the NSA collects information about every phone call placed in the United States, sucks up massive amounts of internet data through programs like PRISM, taps the communications cables that make up the internet, and spies on foreign leaders like German chancellor Angela Merkel. </p>
           <p>The world may have been shocked to learn the then 29-year-old’s age, but Snowden’s familiarity with the ebb and flow of the 24-hour news cycle served him well when he stepped forward and told his story, AMA-style, on <em>The Guardian</em>’s website. </p>
           <p>Now considered a fugitive in his home country, Snowden fled the US to Hong Kong and eventually traveled to Russia, where he’s currently living under asylum. “I don’t want to live in a society that does these sort of things,” Snowden said in June. “I do not expect to see home again.” </p>

Fueled by the book&#8217;s success, Sandberg is widely expected to leave Facebook in the next year. Nobody would be surprised if her next move was into politics.</p>

           <p>Netflix was co-founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings as a mail-order movie rental competitor to chain brick-and-mortars like Blockbuster. It started offering digital subscriptions in 1999, and as of this year has nearly 40 million subscribers.</p>
           <p>In that time, the way we watch movies and television at home has undergone massive upheaval: Blockbuster is bankrupt, streaming is mainstream, and on-demand “binge watching” is an acceptable pastime. </p>
           <p>But Hastings went further, deciding to invest heavily in original shows available only on Netflix —  an incredibly risky and unprecedented move. The strategy has proven to be a winner — <em>House of Cards</em> earned nine Emmy nominations, and <em>Orange is the New Black</em> earned the company its best reviews to date. </p>
           <p>This fall Netflix surpassed HBO in monthly subscribers. That squares with Hastings’ prediction that in the future, channels will be replaced by apps. Major broadcast companies have all followed Netflix’s lead in building software — but Hastings’ long experience in software development may prove a decisive advantage. </p>

           <p>Joss Whedon’s résumé is like a best-of list of cultural high points. He was ahead of the curve with 2008’s online-only <em>Dr. Horrible’s Sing-Along Blog</em>, not to mention the <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> series. In 2012 he directed the global phenomenon <em>The Avengers</em>, which is now the third highest-grossing film of all time. Whedon has served as point man while geek culture has become one of entertainment’s driving forces.</p>
           <p>The fact that his output in 2013 seems uncharacteristically low — he <em>only</em> released a feature-film version of Shakespeare’s <em>Much Ado About Nothing</em> in black and white and helped launched Marvel’s <em>Agents of SHIELD</em> television series — is just one more indication of how much we expect from him.

           <p>Empires have been built, wars have been waged, and great houses have crumbled on the permanence of content, and we&#8217;ve come to expect everything to be accessible, indexed, and searchable from anywhere we are. Snapchat, an app that makes photo and video messages disappear after a set time, was easy to write off when it launched in late 2011. Based in Los Angeles, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy were inspired in part by Anthony Weiner's dick-pic scandal — not exactly a founding story to get Silicon Valley VCs or new users fired up about. </p>
           <p>But the pair was on to something: unburdened by poorly framed, blurry photos living on into eternity and the risk of failure or permanence, you start experimenting. And that appeal goes far beyond sexts: the founders turned down a gargantuan $3 billion acquisition offer from Mark Zuckerberg (three times what  Facebook paid for Instagram) and Google&#8217;s $4 billion followup bid. </p>

Despite international condemnation, a court sentenced all three to two years in prison, though Samutsevich was later released on probation. </p>
              <p>In September of 2013, Tolokonnikova began a hunger strike from prison, describing horrific conditions and slave labor; after an abrupt disappearance, she later emerged in another prison&#8217;s hospital wing.

           <p>But the company has been mired in a series of lawsuits as cable companies and broadcasters have challenged the legality of Aereo&#8217;s model. Kanojia seems undaunted, however, and with backing from Barry Diller he has a shot to get past the legalities and focus on the business. </p>
           <p>He has plenty of experience to work with when he does. Kanojia&#8217;s last venture — Navic Networks — reportedly sold to Microsoft for more than $200 million. Kanojia sees TV as a &#8220;fortress,&#8221; but one that isn&#8217;t closed off to innovation. &#8220;I&#8217;m going to do something that moves the center of gravity to a different medium,&#8221; he told <em>The Verge</em> last June, &#8220;that allows me to get in.&#8221;</p>

           <p>Charged with steering NASA into the 21st century and reinvigorating the lagging American space program, Charles Bolden has so far navigated that challenging course with aplomb. He did, after all, come prepared: Bolden spent more than 30 years in the US Marine Corps before retiring as a major general, and logged nearly 700 hours in space during his own stint as a NASA astronaut. Bolden was in 2009 appointed to head up NASA by President Obama, making him the first African-American to oversee the agency, and he’s vowed to “turn science fiction into science fact.” He made headlines for spurning congressional pressure and orienting the agency’s priorities firmly away from a return visit to the moon. Bolden’s sights are set on some further-reaching targets: he’s cited a manned mission to Mars as NASA’s preeminent goal.</p>

           <p>Nate Silver is never wrong. Or, at least, he’s wrong so infrequently that he’s turned predictive wizardry into a calling card — and managed to take terms like “big data” and “primary polls” mainstream. A longtime baseball aficionado, Silver started out crunching sports predictions. But in 2007 he turned his online attention to politics and made a series of freakishly accurate forecasts under the pseudonym “Poblano” at his FiveThirtyEight blog. He’s gone on to accurately predict two federal elections, moved his blog to <em>The New York Times</em>, and published a bestselling book — <em>The Signal and The Noise</em>. Silver will soon relaunch FiveThirtyEight under ESPN, and has predicted the site will be one-third politics, one-third sports, and “one-third… everything else put together.” We’ll take him on his word at that.</p>

           <p>As her opponents invoked several questionable points of order to silence her, a colleague of Texas state senator Wendy Davis rose for a parliamentary inquiry. “At what point must a female senator raise her hand to be recognized over her male colleagues in the room?,” Senator Leticia Van De Putte asked. That was the moment during state senator Wendy Davis’ 11-hour filibuster the agitated citizens packing the Texas legislature erupted in applause, drowning out the business of the floor in protest of a controversial law that would restrict abortions in the state. While TV broadcasts were focused on the caloric content of blueberry muffins, Davis’ historic stand captivated and dominated the internet. Now, she’s hoping to carry that momentum into something bigger: on November 9th, she officially put her hat in the ring to become the next governor of Texas.</p>

           <p>Directors will often find one thing they do really well and stick with it. Maybe it’s a genre, maybe it’s a storytelling trick; in the long run, we find ourselves wondering when they’re going to give us just a <em>little</em> bit more. Rian Johnson has spent the past decade taking the opposite approach. </p>
           <p>For his first feature outing we got the high school neo-noir <em>Brick</em>. That was followed up by the madcap adventure <em>The Brothers Bloom</em>, and last year he showed his sci-fi skills with the action-drama <em>Looper</em>. Along the way he’s shifted gears into television, delivering some of the most evocative and memorable episodes of <em>Breaking Bad</em>. (Remember “The Fly” bottle episode, and this past season’s emotional gut-kick “Ozymandias”? Those were Johnson’s.) While he’s still writing his next film, we imagine it will do the same thing each of his other projects has: share his unique take on the world through the lens of a camera.</p>

          <p>Janelle Monae’s stock-in-trade is musical science fiction. Lacking the hackneyed futurism of Sun Ra or the &#8220;bad acid trip&#8221; vibe of the P-Funk Mothership, Monae&#8217;s rise began in 2003 with self-released album <em>The Audition</em>. Less than four years later she was BFFs with Prince, an artist on Bad Boy Records, and had her first commercially available release under her belt. Her latest, <em>The Electric Lady</em>, draws from influences as diverse as Debussy, Philip K. Dick, and Fritz Lang&#8217;s <em>Metropolis</em> — although in many ways that&#8217;s all just window dressing for a fresh mix of soul and R&amp;B, funk and gospel, which fans would love even if she didn&#8217;t perform under the guise of a messianic &#8220;Archandroid&#8221; named Cindi or evade questions about her sexuality by saying that she only dates humanoid robots.</p>

That site has morphed into a nonprofit company by the same name, dedicated to creating free, open-source tools that collect and disseminate information — via text, Twitter, email, and other channels — submitted by those on the ground. Those tools have been used to document violence, monitor elections, and assist in the aftermath of natural disasters, including the 2010 Haiti earthquake.

           <p>Lena Dunham had been honing her skills with films like <em>Tiny Furniture</em>, but it was her HBO series <em>Girls,</em> produced by Judd Apatow, that set off a firestorm of controversy when it debuted in 2012.

           <p>But what matters is that Dunham’s half-hour comedy broke into the mainstream and got people thinking and talking frankly about sex. <em>Girls</em>’ second season proved even stronger than the first, and with the next one just around the corner — and a collection of essays on the horizon — we’re looking forward to being challenged by Dunham in as many mediums as possible.</p>

           <p>Filmmaker Laura Poitras has spent nearly a decade documenting the global effects of America’s wars. In 2005 she spent eight months in Iraq profiling Dr. Riyadh al-Adhadh, a Baghdad physician who’d run for political office. The resulting film, <em>My Country, My Country</em>, vividly captured Iraqi life under US occupation. </p>
           <p>Her follow-up, <em>The Oath</em>, featured two Yemeni, Muslim men; one, Salim Ahmed Hamdan, was the first defendant tried in the US military tribunals. (His conviction was later overturned.) The work resulted in harassment by American authorities, she said, including hours-long interrogations at border crossings and confiscation of her computer and reporter’s notes. </p>
           <p>For the third movie in her trilogy, she turned to the topic of US surveillance after 9/11, and particularly legal actions against whistleblowers; Bill Binney, who spoke out publicly about mismanagement at the NSA, became one of her subjects. Along with Glenn Greenwald, she helped publish the documents leaked by Edward Snowden in 2013.</p>
